    <p><b>
        Krishnagiri Fort, situated in the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, India, is a formidable
         historical stronghold that has witnessed the ebb and flow of various dynasties and colonial 
         powers. This fortification, now preserved as a national monument under the auspices of the
          Archaeological Survey of India, holds a rich history dating back centuries.During the 18th
           century, the fort faced yet another change in rulership when Hyder Ali, on the orders of Chikka
            Devaraja Wodeyar, the King of Mysore, captured the fort and the wider Baramahal region. 
            Later, Hyder Ali usurped control of these territories from the Mysorean monarchy and 
            established his own capital in Srirangapatna. In 1768 AD, Krishnagiri Fort eventually
             surrendered to the British forces following a protracted blockade during the First
        Anglo-Mysore War. Subsequently, Hyder Ali reclaimed control of the fort, 
        culminating in the Treaty of Madras.
