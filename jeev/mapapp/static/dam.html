    <h1>Kelavarapalli Dam</h1>
    <hr color="black">
    <p><b>The Krishnagiri Dam, also known as Krishnagiri Reservoir Project (KRP) Dam, is located near 
        Krishnagiri town in Tamil Nadu, India. Built across the Thenpennai River, this dam was constructed 
        in 1958 to support irrigation and water supply in the region. Surrounded by scenic hills and lush greenery,
         the Krishnagiri Dam is not only a vital source of water for agriculture but also a popular picnic spot for
          locals and tourists. The reservoir created by the dam helps irrigate thousands of acres of farmland,
           playing a key role in the regionâ€™s agricultural development. Its peaceful environment and natural 
           beauty make it a favored destination for nature lovers and weekend travelers.
